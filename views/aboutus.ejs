                I am a software developer with a background in real estate acquisitions. My experience has primarily focused on the acquisition of single standing NNN properties as well as foreclosed residential. My most recent experience has been as a student at Code Fellows where I have been able to develop and fine tune my coding skills as a professional developer. I enjoy coding and developing web applications and it gives me an avenue to utilize my creative skills and passion for building.

                I am a software developer with previous experience of user requirement analysis, system implementer and trainer. My inspiration to become a software developer comes from machines simulating human intelligence in so many useful ways so that I decided to be part of that solution and looking for a role as Artificial Intelligence Engineer.
