## Getting Started
To get this app running one must create a front-end intake form for food queries and a back-end server for api calls to Food Puppy.

## Architecture
CSS Stylesheets for the front end display utilizing ejs to render content on the page. Back end server to make api calls and run the entire application.  Javascript and JQuery to add additional functionality.
